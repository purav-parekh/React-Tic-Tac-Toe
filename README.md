# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Why this project?

I worked on this project as a part of my efforts to learn & get comfortable with React. <br>
This project gave me a good overview on state management, and introduced me to Hooks with the useState Hook. <br>
The project tutorial that I followed while building this project was from [Hitesh Choudhary/LearnCodeOnline](https://learncodeonline.com) and can be found here: [Course](https://courses.learncodeonline.in/learn/home/Complete-ReactJS-developer-Bootcamp/)
